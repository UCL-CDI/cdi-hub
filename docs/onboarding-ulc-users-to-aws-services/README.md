# Onboarding CDI-UCL users to AWS services

We recommend covering the following points for your onboarding to AWS services. 

## Creating an AWS Account
We recommend setting up a personal AWS account by following the steps in the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html). 
Your AWS account number is a unique 12-digit number, such as 012345678901, that identifies your AWS account. 

## Redeeming AWS Credits
Using your UCL email please email us to cdi-info@ucl.ac.uk with the following details:

Once you have your AWS account setup, we will provide details on loggin into your AWS access portal. For instance: 
* Going into https://ucl-cloud.awsapps.com/start ang log in into aws access porta to select either `cdi-innov-dev` or `arc-playpen-collaborations` and then launch AWSAdministratorAccess with zone `eu-west-2`.
* Log in with your AWS profile [using bash script(s) such as aws-config-login.bash](https://github.com/UCL-CDI/cdi-hub/tree/main/tutorials/aws-services/aws-batch#log-in-with-your-aws-profile)

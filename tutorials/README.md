# Tutorials

## Infrastructure Overview
The following tutorials provide both local and AWS setups to implement best practices in software and machine learning development. Key features include:
1. pyproject: Tracks dependencies for streamlined project management.
2. Pre-commit hooks: Ensures high-quality code with automated checks.
3. Unit tests with pytest: Enables robust testing for data processing, model selection, training, inference, and evaluation, aligning with the FDA's Good Machine Learning Practices [(FDA 2021)](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/software-medical-device-samd/good-machine-learning-practice-medical-device-development-guiding-principles).
4. Documentation (docs, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT): Provides guidance for setup and requirements, outlines contribution protocols, and establishes a code of conduct to foster effective collaboration.
5. Datasets (datasets): Manages data policies, preparation, and preprocessing needs.
6. Source folder (src): Organises APIs, models, and utilities for clarity and scalability.

This structured approach fosters efficient, maintainable, and scalable workflows!

## End-to-End AI Workflow for Automated Multimodal Medical Image Reporting
This project leverages multimodal data, combining X-rays and doctors' reports, to predict diseases in unseen X-ray datasets. It is designed for both local execution and integration with AWS services. See further details [here](automated-multimodal-medical-image-reporting).

## AWS services
This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to AWS services, including setting up, creating resources, configuring architecture, estimating resource costs, and benchmarking results. For more details, see [here](aws-services).
